# Meteorological data from "Cobertura Verde"

The following data refers to a meteorological station ([ATMOS41](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gcrmu_V8oGEzP8LdJoZoUTuRhioKaJr5/view?usp=sharing)) installed in the "Cobertura Verde" of the "Forum da Maia". 

The meteorological station is located at (Lat, Lon) (41.234143, -8.623105), and the overall layout for the green roof can be checked at http://baze.cm-maia.pt/BaZe/base2b.htm?e0=Cverde2.  

Overall, the data spans from November 25<sup>th</sup> 2021 to April 22<sup>nd</sup> 2024 - data was collected and stored avery 15 min (roughly), for a total of 40405 points. There are some short periods with missing values.    

## CSV data
The [CVerdevarios.csv](https://github.com/pedroccpimenta/D4fa/blob/main/HistoriMeteo/CVerdevarios.csv) file has been exported from the database - first column is datetime (day/month/year hour:min:sec), second column is air Temperature (&deg;C), third column is atmospheric Pressure (Pa), fourth column if Relative Humidity (%) and las column is radiation (W/m<sup>2</sup>), variables separated by "," - it should be easily load into Excel(R), LibreOffice, Power BI or browsed by any text editor.

## Ploting Temp and Radiation
The very first task would be to 'study' then data and be able to use wathever tool you prefer to plot the Temperature and Radiation against date - the overall behaviour of these variables can be shown at

### Older examples

We can also plot the variables across 'the same months', resulting in:
