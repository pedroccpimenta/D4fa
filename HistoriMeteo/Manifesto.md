# Meteorological data from "Cobertura Verde"

The following data refers to a meteorological station ([ATMOS41](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gcrmu_V8oGEzP8LdJoZoUTuRhioKaJr5/view?usp=sharing)) installed in the "Cobertura Verde" of the "Forum da Maia". 

The meteorological station is located at (Lat, Lon) (41.234143, -8.623105), and the overall layout for the green roof can be checked at http://baze.cm-maia.pt/BaZe/base2b.htm?e0=Cverde2.  

Overall, the data spans from November 25<sup>th</sup> 2021 to April 22<sup>nd</sup> 2024 - data was collected and stored every 15 min (roughly), for a total of 82600 points. There are some (short) periods with missing values.    

## CSV data
The [CVerdevarios.csv](https://github.com/pedroccpimenta/D4fa/blob/main/HistoriMeteo/CVerdevarios.csv) file has been exported from the database - first column is datetime (day/month/year hour:min:sec), second column is air temperature (&deg;C), third column is atmospheric pressure (Pa), fourth column if relative humidity (%) and last column is radiation (W/m<sup>2</sup>), variables separated by "," - it should be easily load into Excel(R), LibreOffice, Power BI, Tableau or browsed by any text editor.

## Ploting Temp and Radiation
The very first task would be to plot (using wathever tool you prefer) the Temperature and Radiation against date - the overall behaviour of these variables can be shown at

We can also plot the variables across 'the same months', resulting in:
